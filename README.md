### To-do list

* Besides books, add a few relevant papers and pointers to videos
    - On GLMs, O'Hara's paper <https://doi.org/10.5735/086.046.0205>
    - On GLMMs, Bolker's TREE paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2008.10.008> and FAQ <https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html>
    - On Bayesian analyses, McElreath lectures and videos <https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019> 
* Include more ecological examples, and maybe use just one or two examples throughout
* Consider an example mixing continuous and discrete explanatory variables
* Illustrate how to report results
    - Have a look to recent papers in the journal you’re targeting
    - Check out Zuur's books
    - Read <http://bit.ly/2v9dAI8>
* Introduce the tidyverse. Or refer to some material I wrote <https://github.com/oliviergimenez/intro_tidyverse>
